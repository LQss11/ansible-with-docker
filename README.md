# dindood
`DinDooD` is a repository that helps you play around with a cluster of nodes as docker containers.
## Working environment  
In order to help you understand the working environment you will first need to learn the difference between **dind** and **dood**:
- `DinD` includes a whole **Docker installation inside** of it.
- `DooD` uses its underlying hostâ€™s Docker installation by **bind-mounting the Docker socket**.

You can see that we have only one DooD Container and at the same time we could have multiple DinD containers running, that would in fact create a **cluster-like** environment.

### DinD Configuration
1. Pull a linux Distribution Docker Image.
1. Install few packages that we might need (curl wget..).
1. Install docker and docker-compose.
1. Install OpenSSH.
1. Expose port 22 for ssh.
1. Change root password and update ssh as root permission.
1. Start Dcoker and OpenSSH services.
Also one of the important things about it is that all the containers created as dind share the same images through the docker compose configuration through a volume called docker-storage.
### Dood Configuration
The configuration is basically the same except that we don't need to install docker or docker compose because simply we have a `/var/run/docker.sock` bind mount.
## Quick Start
In order to create your cluster with one **controller (DooD)** and multiple **agents (DinD)** as you can specify the number of agents you need, you can run:
```sh
docker-compose -p dindood_cluster up -d --scale agent=2 --build
```
Now that you have your cluster up you can rescale the number of agents by running the same command with `--no-recreate` flag that will avoid recreating old containers (nodes):
```sh
docker-compose -p dindood_cluster up -d --scale agent=4 --build --no-recreate
```
Once you are done with the cluster you can stop it by running:
```sh
docker-compose -p dindood_cluster down
```
